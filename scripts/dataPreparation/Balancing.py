Usage: python NotBlockedBalancing.py

Randomly samples blocked/notBlocked files to be of same size. See the argparse
description for more information.

If the --lines argument is missing, this script will print the number of lines
in data/regular/blocked_full.txt as used by dataPreparation/separate.sh.
